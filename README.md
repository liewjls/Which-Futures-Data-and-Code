The objective is: analyse how demand for elderly (residential) care will change over the next 20 years, and how much it will cost.

Our driving questions are:

How much will it cost to keep a person in res care, in 2020 and 2035
    1) How many extra beds will England need to provide for its elderly population, in 2020 and 2035
    2) How much will it cost local authorities to provide these beds, in 2020 and 2035
